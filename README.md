Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JobConnect-Web-App.git
cd JobConnect-Web-App

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username and JobConnect-Web-App with your repository name.)

Open in Browser:
Since this is primarily a static HTML/CSS/JS project, you can simply open any of the .html files directly in your web browser (e.g., index.html, signin.html).

For full functionality (e.g., form submissions, dynamic content):
For a better development experience and to simulate server behavior for form submissions (which are currently logged to the console), it's recommended to use a simple local web server.

Using VS Code Live Server: If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey. Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server."

Using Node.js http-server:

# Install http-server globally (if you don't have it)
npm install -g http-server
# Navigate to your project root and run
http-server .

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8080 (or the port indicated).

Project Status
This project is currently an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) developed as a final year academic project. We are continuously working on adding more features and refining existing ones.

Future Enhancements
Based on the project documentation and industry standards, planned future enhancements include:

Multilingual Support: Full internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages (e.g., English, Twi, Ewe).

Advanced Job Search Filters: Implement more granular filtering options (experience level, job type, salary range, etc.).

Interview Scheduling Integration: Integrate with calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar) for automated interview bookings.

Real-time Notification System: Implement in-app and/or email notifications for application status updates, new job matches, etc.

Built-in Messaging System: Allow direct communication between employers and job seekers within the platform.
